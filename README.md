# duber-2-cheerville
A small program made for ICS3U6 for OOP assignment, which simulates the happy people of Cheerville and their adventures to forage for food, reproduce, and avoid the nasty zombies.

Overall, pretty pleased with this one. I like the priority algorithm I implemented on this one, although the exact implementation could have been worked on more. I also didn't know how to use JFrames and swing properly, so that area is pretty yikes.

Also hehe `ConcurrentModificationException` really goes brrr on this assignment.
